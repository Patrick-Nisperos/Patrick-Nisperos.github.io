      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Patrick, I love to shoot hoops, explore philosophy, nature, and car culture. I also enjoy solving problems, and building stuff.
        <br>
        When I was a kid (early 2000's), I enjoyed math more than other subjects. Also, this was the time
        schools started to introduce computers to students, and homes with personal computers were <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/184685/percentage-of-households-with-computer-in-the-united-states-since-1984/" target="_blank">gradually increasing.</a>
        I got excited every time I got the chance to use a computer because I realized you can do so many things with them, and eventually started touch typing which was relatively rare amongst my generation at the time.
        When I got my first laptop, I often played a PC game called Warcraft III, and created my own custom games using its
         <a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_III_World_Editor">game engine</a> and found it more fun than playing the actual game. Then was lucky to have had a computer elective in middle school,
         where we learned how to code using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">scratch</a>. Then I got lucky again, when in my high school they offered a computer programming and game development elective
         where I made custom games in <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US">Unreal Engine 4</a>. By this point, I was still confused on what to do in terms of career.
         Because I still had a great interest in cars and nature, I debated mech engineering and bio engineering. But figured my talent and passion in computing would be more fufilling to me.
         So I studied computer science in college to become a software developer while working part-time jobs throughout the process. And did not regret it.
        
        <br><br>
        TLDR: I liked math, I typed fast, and enjoyed creating. I went to college to study computer science, so I can build software for a living.
        <br>
