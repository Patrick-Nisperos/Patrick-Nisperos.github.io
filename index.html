    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>"The world is a reflection of yourself. You do not see the world as it is, you see the world as you are."</p>
    <p>I am building a personal website for the purposes of relearning html/css. And to pick up the language of JavaScript.
        This would be hosted on my github pages. Good luck future Patrick!, from past Patrick.
